          <h2>About the Game</h2>
          <p>Tap yes or no. Rule your kingdom. Sort the Court! puts you on the throne with a single rule: answer every petition with a yes or a no. Each choice shapes your realm, from bustling markets to mysterious visitors in the night.</p>
          <p>The game is built around a simple but powerful idea: the smallest decisions can lead to the most complex outcomes. You do not negotiate or manage menus. You make a clear call, and the kingdom responds.</p>
          <p>At first glance, it feels effortless. You can start playing instantly with no sign-up, no download, and no complicated controls. Yet beneath that simplicity lies a game that rewards attention, intuition, and long-term thinking.</p>
          <p>Sort the Court! is a free browser-based decision game that blends casual strategy with light narrative elements. Designed for short and engaging play sessions, the game puts players in the role of a ruler who must guide a growing kingdom using only simple yes-or-no decisions. Each choice directly affects key aspects of the realm, including population, citizen happiness, and available gold.</p>
          <p>Unlike complex strategy simulations, Sort the Court! focuses on intuitive decision making rather than micromanagement. Players are presented with a steady stream of visitors, each offering requests, warnings, or opportunities. While every decision appears simple on the surface, the long-term consequences can be surprising, making the game both accessible to newcomers and rewarding for thoughtful players.</p>
          <p>As a casual HTML5 browser game, Sort the Court! requires no downloads, no installation, and no account creation. It runs smoothly on modern desktop and mobile browsers, making it an ideal choice for players looking to enjoy a complete strategy experience online in just a few minutes. Whether you are interested in narrative-driven games, choice-based simulations, or relaxing casual gameplay, Sort the Court! offers a unique and memorable experience.</p>

          <h2>Every Choice Has Weight</h2>
          <p>Visitors arrive with requests, warnings, and opportunities. A villager may ask for help, a merchant might offer a risky deal, and a knight could warn you of trouble ahead.</p>
          <p>There are no clearly marked “good” or “bad” answers. A generous decision might win the love of your people while draining the treasury. A cautious refusal could protect resources but quietly lower morale.</p>
          <p>Some outcomes appear instantly, others emerge days later. A small choice today can return in an unexpected way tomorrow.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>The Core Is Balance</h2>
          <p>Your kingdom survives only as long as population, happiness, and gold remain stable. Ignore your people, and unrest may grow. Spend too freely, and your coffers will run dry.</p>
          <p>Success comes not from maximizing one number, but from keeping the realm in harmony. The story of your rule is written in those tradeoffs.</p>

          <h2>Meaningful Choices Over Speed</h2>
          <p>What makes Sort the Court! stand out is its focus on meaningful choices rather than speed or complexity. The game encourages players to think carefully about each response, as even small decisions can ripple through the kingdom over time.</p>
          <p>A choice that increases gold today may reduce happiness tomorrow, while a kind gesture could strengthen population growth at an unexpected cost.</p>

          <h2>Calm but Engaging</h2>
          <p>This balance-driven gameplay creates a calm yet engaging experience. There are no time limits, no fast reactions required, and no pressure to optimize perfectly.</p>
          <p>Players are free to experiment with different ruling styles, explore alternative outcomes, and discover how their decisions shape the story of their reign.</p>
